# Orca: Agentic Stock Analysis & Forecasting

**Google 5-Day AI Agents Intensive  Capstone Project**

##  Overview

Orca is an intelligent, autonomous stock analysis agent that revolutionizes how retail investors understand the market. Unlike traditional static dashboards that merely display data, Orca actively *investigates* stocks for you, combining quantitative finance with cutting-edge multi-LLM reasoning to deliver institutional-grade insights in plain English.

### The Problem We Solve

Retail investors face an overwhelming paradox: they have access to the same raw data as Wall Street professionalsprice charts, technical indicators, SEC filings, news feedsbut lack the time, expertise, and tools to synthesize this information into actionable insights. Existing solutions fall into two extremes:

- **Too Simple**: Basic charting apps that show price movements but offer no context or analysis
- **Too Complex**: Professional terminals (Bloomberg, Reuters) with steep learning curves and prohibitive costs

**Orca bridges this gap**, acting as your personal AI quantitative analyst that doesn't just show you datait *explains* it.

##  Key Features

###  Multi-Agent Orchestration
Orca implements a sophisticated "Think-Act-Observe" loop inspired by the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK):
- **Think**: Analyzes market data and determines which tools to use
- **Act**: Executes calculations, fetches data, and runs forecasts
- **Observe**: Synthesizes results and learns from outcomes

###  Multi-Model Consensus ("Panel of Experts")
Instead of relying on a single AI model, Orca orchestrates multiple specialized LLMs working in parallel:
- **Mistral 7B**: General reasoning and balanced analysis
- **Phi-3 Mini**: Efficient, concise technical insights
- **Llama 3.1 8B**: Deep, structured fundamental analysis
- **Gemma 7B**: Sentiment-aware market psychology
- **Qwen2 7B**: Balanced logical reasoning

Each model analyzes the stock independently, providing diverse perspectives that reduce bias and hallucinations.

###  Judge-Evaluated Outputs
A separate "Judge" model (DeepSeek-R1) evaluates all expert responses using strict criteria:
- **Accuracy** (0-2 points): Factual correctness
- **Depth of Analysis** (0-2 points): Insight quality beyond surface-level observations
- **Relevance** (0-2 points): Direct addressing of the user's question
- **Clarity & Structure** (0-2 points): Communication effectiveness
- **Actionability** (0-2 points): Practical value for decision-making

Only the highest-scoring response is presented to the user, ensuring quality and reducing information overload.

###  Advanced Custom Tools

#### Technical Indicators
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Identifies overbought/oversold conditions
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Detects trend changes and momentum
- **Bollinger Bands**: Measures volatility and price extremes
- **Moving Averages**: MA20 and MA50 for trend identification

#### ML Price Forecasting
- Linear regression model trained on historical price data
- Full audit trail for reproducibility and trust

###  Session Memory & Context Awareness
Persistent memory system that enables natural conversations:
- **Short-term Memory**: Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions
- **Long-term Memory**: Stores user preferences (risk tolerance, favorite sectors, investment horizon)
- **Contextual Responses**: Adapts analysis based on previous interactions

##  Architecture

Orca follows the **Model + Tools + Orchestration** pattern from the Google ADK:

         (Interactive Dashboard + Chat Canvas)            

                     

                  Orchestrator                            
         (ADK Agent - Think-Act-Observe Loop)

  ML           Model                
   Forecast                          
  Quantum                           
   Risk                              
    
```
