# FinSight-X: Video Demo Script (3 Minutes)

## 0:00 - 0:30: The Problem & Introduction
**Visual:** Show a split screen of a complex stock terminal (like Bloomberg) and a confused retail investor looking at a simple line chart.
**Audio:** "Retail investors are drowning in data but starving for insights. You have price charts, technical indicators, news, and analyst ratings—but putting it all together is overwhelming. Existing tools are either too simple or too complex."
**Visual:** Cut to FinSight-X Logo and Tagline: "Your AI Quantitative Analyst".
**Audio:** "Introducing FinSight-X, an intelligent agent that doesn't just show you data—it explains it. Built for the Google AI Agents Capstone, it combines quantitative finance with multi-model AI reasoning."

## 0:30 - 1:00: The Solution (Demo)
**Visual:** Screen recording of the FinSight-X Web App.
**Action:** Type "AAPL" into the search bar.
**Audio:** "Let's look at Apple. I simply enter the ticker."
**Action:** The dashboard loads. Point out the 'Think-Act-Observe' trace updating in real-time.
**Audio:** "Under the hood, FinSight-X isn't just a chatbot. It's an agent. Watch the 'Glass Box' trace here. It's fetching live data, calculating indicators like RSI and MACD, and even running a custom Quantum-Inspired risk analysis."

## 1:00 - 1:45: Multi-Agent Architecture
**Visual:** Show an animated diagram of the architecture (Orchestrator -> Tools -> Panel of Experts -> Judge).
**Audio:** "Here's where it gets powerful. We use a 'Panel of Experts' approach. Instead of relying on one LLM, we have multiple models—Mistral, Phi-3, and Llama-3—analyze the data independently."
**Visual:** Show the "Consensus" section of the UI where different model opinions are visible.
**Audio:** "Then, a 'Judge' model evaluates their responses for accuracy and depth, selecting the single best insight for you. This reduces hallucinations and ensures you get high-quality, balanced advice."

## 1:45 - 2:30: Key Features & Tools
**Visual:** Zoom in on the "Quantum Risk" metric and the "Forecast" chart.
**Audio:** "We've built custom tools that go beyond standard charts. Our 'Quantum Risk' metric amplifies volatility signals to warn you of hidden dangers, and our ML forecast projects trends 30 days out."
**Visual:** Show the "Session Memory" by asking a follow-up question like "What about for a long-term hold?"
**Audio:** "And it remembers. The agent maintains session memory, so you can have a natural conversation, refining your strategy just like you would with a human analyst."

## 2:30 - 3:00: Conclusion
**Visual:** Quick montage of the code (VS Code), the GitHub repo, and the final report.
**Audio:** "FinSight-X bridges the gap between institutional analysis and retail simplicity. It's transparent, agentic, and powerful. Check out the code on GitHub and try it yourself."
**Visual:** "FinSight-X: Trade Smarter." (Fade to black with links).
